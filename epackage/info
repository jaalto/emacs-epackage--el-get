Description: package manager to download and install Emacs extensions
 Install and manage elisp code for Emacs. It supports lots of differents
 types of sources and is able to install them, update them and remove them,
 but more importantly it will init them for you.
 .
 That means it will require the features you need, load the necessary files,
 set the Info paths so that C-h i shows the new documentation you now
 depend on, and finally call your own :post-init function for you to setup
 the extension. Or call it a package.
